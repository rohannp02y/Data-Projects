# Data-Projects
Welcome to my AI and data science portfolio! Iâ€™m a 19-year-old freelancer learning Python to deliver data annotation, dataset cleaning, and basic scripting for web scraping or automation. Below are my projects showcasing skills for AI and business needs.

## Projects
- **Dataset Cleaning**: Cleaned a Kaggle dataset (e.g., Titanic) using Python and Pandas, removing duplicates and filling missing values.
- **Web Scraping**: Built a Python script with BeautifulSoup to scrape quotes from a public website.
- **Data Annotation**: Created a script to label customer reviews as positive/negative based on keywords.
